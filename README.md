# Kama 
## Project Info

Kama is a stupid image analysis system designed for physics experiments, primarily used for real-time capture, processing, and analysis of camera images. It supports ring detection and brightness variation measurement, making it suitable for Michelson interference fringe detection.

## main function

[x] Real-time image acquisition from camera

### CNN-based ring center detection (in progress; polar coordinate-based methods under consideration)

### Brightness analysis at specified image regions

### Visualization of brightness variation trends

### Basic interactive user interface

## Teach Stack

- **language**：Python
- **Processing Stack**：OpenCV
- **Framework**：PyTorch
- **GUI**：PyQt6
